## 5.1 Linkage layer — never merge, always link
- Patient UUIDs are immortal and immutable; clinical events reference their original UUID forever (sole exception: reattribution overlay, [§5.5](#55-reattribution-one-primitive-tiered-workflows)).
- Identity is an append-only stream of **link / unlink assertions** with provenance, HLC, confidence.
- The "person" (golden identity) is a projection: the connected component of the link graph. The unified chart unions the event streams of all member UUIDs.
- Consequences: merges sync trivially (events union); redundant links are idempotent; **unmerge is always possible and clean** (split the component; nothing was rewritten).

## 5.2 Matching pipeline (safety-asymmetric: false merge ≫ worse than false split)
- **Deterministic tier:** exact match on a strong identifier → auto-link with provenance.
- **Probabilistic tier:** Fellegi–Sunter-style scoring; conservative auto-link threshold; wide middle band raises a "possible duplicate" banner on both charts (surfacing safety content — allergies, active meds — without co-mingling) and queues human reconciliation.
- **Locale-pluggable comparators:** phonetic encodings, name structures, DOB precision handling, address semantics are deployment configuration, not hardcoded.
- **Where matching runs follows topology:** at registration within local scope (search-before-create); cross-facility at the lowest tier that sees both registrations (typically the hub); link events flow down through normal sync.
- **Coherence check (feedback loop):** the unified-chart projection continuously validates linked components against the [§4.2](demographics.md#42-per-field-projection-policy) conflict column. Contradictions (same-system identifier mismatch, verified-DOB clash, sex-at-birth clash) demote the link to human review and render the chart in *under-review* trust mode. Every new demographic assertion cheaply re-triggers local matching.

> [!NOTE]
> The matcher is **advisory** — it *proposes* link candidates (Python; see
> [technology.md](technology.md)). Applying the closed event algebra and maintaining its
> projections is authoritative, in-database logic. The seam between them is the database boundary
> ([language-substrate §9.3–§9.4](language-substrate.md#93-integration-boundary)).

## 5.3 Registration classes
| Class | Use | Properties |
|---|---|---|
| **Standard** | Normal registration | Search-before-create enforced funnel |
| **Unidentified** | Unconscious/unknown patient ("John Doe") | [§5.4](#54-unidentified-registration-john-doe-baked-into-the-root) |
| **Pseudonymous (sanctioned)** | Legally permitted anonymous/protective care | [§5.6](#56-pseudonymous-sanctioned-care) |

Registrations created during a partition are tagged and go to the **head of the upstream matching queue on reconnect** — post-partition reconciliation is a scheduled pipeline stage, not an error state.

## 5.4 Unidentified registration (John Doe) — baked into the root
- UUID minted immediately; care proceeds without delay.
- **System-generated callsign** (e.g. `Unknown-ED-<site>-<date>-A`), never plausible fake names; matcher excludes placeholder names from its feature space.
- Identity evidence captured as **clinician-observed assertions**: estimated age with basis, observed sex, photo, distinguishing marks, belongings, EMS pickup context — honest data, full matcher features.
- **Identity-pending is an active workflow state:** chart renders in *unconfirmed* trust mode ("no history available; allergies unknown"); matcher re-runs on every new evidence assertion.
- Resolution = **identification event** (who, method) + ordinary **link assertion** if a prior chart exists. On link during an active encounter, the system **pushes an alert**: "prior history now available — N allergies, M active medications — review now."
- Partition-safe by construction: registration and care are local; identification may occur at hub tier; the link event syncs down normally.

## 5.5 Reattribution — one primitive, tiered workflows

The **reattribution event** — "event set E belongs to UUID-B, not UUID-A" — is an immutable overlay all projections respect (digital strike-through: originals stay in place, excluded from the source chart's projection, visible in its chart-history view). It is **event-granular** (a single note, observation set, or order can move). Granularity lives in the primitive; *risk control lives in the workflow tier*:

| Tier | Use case | Conditions (enforced automatically) | Adjudication |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1 — Self-correction** | Misfiled documentation: clinician with multiple charts open saves into the wrong one (high-frequency, often ≥ weekly per clinician) | Author moves own event(s); within time window (same shift / 24 h, policy-config); destination patient in author's active care context (open/recent encounters) | None — one-click "move to correct patient," picker pre-filled with author's open charts. Full audit automatic. Friction target: < 10 seconds, or it competes with copy-paste-and-lose-provenance or with not fixing it at all |
| **2 — Supervised** | Not the author, window expired, or destination outside care relationship | Any Tier-1 condition unmet | One second sign-off (records officer / senior clinician) |
| **3 — Forensic** | Identity theft, disputes ([§5.5](#55-reattribution-one-primitive-tiered-workflows)), adversarial cases | — | Two-person rule; adjudication queue; affected events render *under-review* on both charts until resolved |

**Auto-escalation:** any event with executed real-world effects (administered medication, performed procedure, transfused product) is barred from Tier 1 and escalates with an incident-workflow flag. Reattribution records documentation truth; it must never paper over a clinical incident.

**Contamination cascade (mandatory on reattribution arrival, local or via sync):**
- Recompute decision support / alerts on both source and destination charts.
- Notify every user who **viewed or acted on** the misfiled content during the exposure window ("a note you read on patient B at 14:32 has been moved to patient A"). Generated locally on each node as the event lands → partition-safe by construction.
- **Disclosure-scope query as a named feature:** exposure window + viewer list is a single query over the append-only audit log (GDPR/HIPAA breach-scoping in seconds, not weeks).

**(a) Fabricated persona (deliberate false identity):** confession → link assertion to real chart + **repudiation events** marking false assertions. Repudiated values leave the displayed projection but enter a **known-alias pool** retained by the matcher (aliases are reused). The fact of presentation under a false name is preserved (medico-legally required).

**(b) Identity theft (events on victim's chart):** Tier-3 reattribution of the affected encounter(s). **Dispute event** as the patient/victim-initiated front door ("I was never there in March"), feeding the review queue.

## 5.6 Pseudonymous (sanctioned) care
- Covers legally permitted anonymous STI testing, protective aliases (domestic violence), staff treated at their own facility.
- Deliberately unlinked; flagged internally; later linking is **patient-initiated and consent-gated**.
- **Link assertions may carry a visibility scope; linking must never silently broaden access.** A sequestered episode joins the person's connected component (enabling e.g. interaction checking) without its contents flooding every chart view. Identity linkage and consent scoping intersect at the link event — this is an architectural invariant, not an edge case.

## 5.7 Identity event algebra (closed set; all append-only, syncable, auditable)
| Event | Resolves | Adjudication |
|---|---|---|
| `assert` | Registration & demographic updates | Automatic |
| `link` / `unlink` | Duplicates, John Doe identification, confessions | Auto above threshold, else human |
| `identify` | Identity-pending → confirmed | Human; method recorded |
| `repudiate` | Known-false assertions → alias pool | Human |
| `reattribute` | Misfiled documentation; wrong-chart contamination; identity theft | Tiered: self-service (author, windowed) / one sign-off / two-person rule ([§5.5](#55-reattribution-one-primitive-tiered-workflows)) |
| `dispute` | Patient-initiated review | Triage to queue |

**Chart trust states (projection-side contract):** *confirmed* / *unconfirmed* (identity-pending) / *under-review* (coherence failure, open dispute, pending reattribution). The chart always tells the clinician how much to trust the identity behind it.

**Biometrics:** excluded from core (vendor/AGPL minefield; poor offline performance on constrained hardware). Accommodated as one more identifier system in the multi-valued set via a pluggable module. The core must work with names, dates, photos, and human judgment alone.

## 5.8 Registration & documentation workflow (normative)
1. **Search-before-create enforced funnel:** "new patient" unreachable until local-scope matching has run; candidates shown with photo/age/locale/last visit; the create button records that N near-matches were displayed.
2. **Partition-aware duplicate expectation** (see [§5.3](#53-registration-classes)).
3. **Wrong-chart protection at point of care (read side):** demographic banner always shows photo + age + provenance-flagged identifiers; cheap "confirm patient" affordances emit verification assertions, raising provenance as a side effect of normal care.
4. **Wrong-chart protection at point of documentation (write side):** every input surface carries persistent patient identity (photo, name, age, per-patient color coding consistent across all open windows). Documentation is bound to an explicit **armed write-context** designed on **possession semantics** (paper precedent: you physically held one chart; the misfile is a disease of windowing, which abstracted possession away). One chart is "in hand" for writing at a time; picking it up is a single natural gesture; which chart is held is as unmissable as the color of a folder. Cross-window paste of patient-bound content is flagged at paste time.

> [!WARNING]
> **Confirmation dialogs are explicitly NOT the wrong-chart safety mechanism** — they fail the
> paper-parity test ([vision §1.2](vision.md#12-the-paper-parity-test-normative)). Restore the
> physical affordance (possession: one chart in one hand) instead.
