# 11. Open Questions (next brainstorming targets)

*Numbering is stable (used as a reference identity elsewhere). Resolved items are kept
struck-through; their resolution lives in the cited document and the linked ADR.*

1. ~~**Build vs. adapt the sync backbone.**~~ **RESOLVED** ([ADR-0001](decisions/0001-fat-postgres-thin-daemon.md), [sync §6.1](sync.md#61-mechanism)): build a thin custom Rust service on logical decoding; borrow pgactive/SymmetricDS patterns, do not depend on them.
2. ~~**Storage model.**~~ **RESOLVED** ([ADR-0001](decisions/0001-fat-postgres-thin-daemon.md), [data-model §3.5](data-model.md#35-event-storage-model-hybrid-envelope)): hybrid event envelope — typed envelope columns where invariants/identity/sync/matching bind; Cairn-native JSONB clinical bodies; FHIR is a façade only.
3. ~~**Dynamic sync scopes.**~~ **RESOLVED** ([ADR-0004](decisions/0004-dynamic-sync-scope-prefetch-not-authority.md), [sync §6.4](sync.md#64-scope-is-a-prefetch-hint-not-an-authority)): scope is an administrative *prefetch hint*, not an authority; a transfer triggers *acquisition*, not reassignment; access follows legitimate-need + audit; the surviving requirement is honest assembly-state disclosure. The case also surfaced the **bitemporal time model** and the **acknowledged-uncertainty** principle — [ADR-0003](decisions/0003-bitemporal-time-and-acknowledged-uncertainty.md), [data-model §3.6](data-model.md#36-bitemporal-event-time-recording-time-vs-effective-time)/[§3.7](data-model.md#37-acknowledged-uncertainty-uncertainty-capable-value-types).
4. **Schema migrations across a fleet of offline nodes:** version-skew tolerance window; forward-compatible event formats.
5. ~~**Tombstones & retention.**~~ **RESOLVED** ([ADR-0005](decisions/0005-erasure-key-custody-and-crypto-shredding.md), [data-model §3.8](data-model.md#38-erasure-and-key-custody), [security §7.1](security.md#71-erasure-the-severity-ladder)): erasure is **redistribution of key-custody, not deletion of data** — crypto-shredding (destroy the DEK, never mutate the append-only log) on an encryption-capable body slot, exposed as a **policy-neutral severity ladder** (hide → sequester → deniable sealed-escrow deletion → audited crypto-shred → best-effort oblivion). Deletion is best-effort and *declared*, never guaranteed; the honest ceiling is *"to our knowledge, we have erased all copies in our existence."* Absorbs the [ADR-0004](decisions/0004-dynamic-sync-scope-prefetch-not-authority.md) surplus-copy-GC follow-on (per-node key custody erases one node's copy while the rightful holder keeps theirs).
6. **Attachment strategy:** inline vs. content-addressed blob store with lazy sync.
7. **Locale-pluggable matcher comparators:** define the extension point (comparator API, weight configuration, evaluation harness per deployment).
8. ~~**Visibility-scope semantics on links.**~~ **RESOLVED** ([ADR-0006](decisions/0006-visibility-scope-replication-and-the-safety-projection.md), [identity §5.9](identity.md#59-sensitivity-grade-the-safety-projection-and-break-glass-visibility-scope), [sync §6.4](sync.md#64-scope-is-a-prefetch-hint-not-an-authority), [security §7](security.md), [data-model §3.5](data-model.md#35-event-storage-model-hybrid-envelope)): **replication is never the confidentiality boundary** — a safety-relevant sensitive episode replicates *unconditionally* (yes, it reaches the node); confidentiality lives only in key-custody + visibility + envelope-abstraction. A sealed body emits a de-identified, severity-graded **safety projection** (mechanical from coded fields) so decision-support warns without disclosing; coarseness is set by a graded, multi-source, append-only **sensitivity** stream (blacklist + grading system + human editability — Cairn ships the mechanism, policy combines them). **Break-glass** is audited key-*use*, partition-honest. Also answers the [ADR-0005](decisions/0005-erasure-key-custody-and-crypto-shredding.md) rung-1 follow-on (what safety metadata remains while a body is sealed).
9. **Armed write-context interaction model:** concrete possession-semantics design ([§5.8](identity.md#58-registration-documentation-workflow-normative)) that passes the paper-parity benchmark at ED pace — "picking up a chart" must cost ≤ its paper equivalent (~seconds, zero cognitive overhead) without degrading into reflexive click-through.
10. **Notification economy:** contamination-cascade and history-arrival alerts ([§5.4](identity.md#54-unidentified-registration-john-doe-baked-into-the-root), [§5.5](identity.md#55-reattribution-one-primitive-tiered-workflows)) are safety-critical but additive; define a priority taxonomy so they don't drown in routine noise.
11. ~~**In-database vs. application-layer merge boundary.**~~ **RESOLVED** ([ADR-0001](decisions/0001-fat-postgres-thin-daemon.md), [language-substrate §9.4](language-substrate.md#94-merge-projection-boundary-fat-postgres-thin-rust-daemon)): structural invariants + identity event algebra + all projections in Postgres (trigger-maintained incremental tables); thin Rust daemon ships/applies but carries no merge logic; matcher stays Python-advisory; per-projection Rust escape hatch on measured Pi-performance need.
12. **Authentication vs. paper-parity tension:** shared-workstation login is the largest parity violation in deployed EHRs ([§1.2](vision.md#12-the-paper-parity-test-normative) vs. [§7](security.md)); adjudicate explicitly — fast/proximity sessions enabled by local-first state vs. security posture.

## Resolved — authorship & accountability (AI-authored clinical information)

The general problem behind "tagging AI-generated content" (AI scribe, transcription, result-grading,
triage, notifications) is **resolved** by founding principle 10 and
[ADR-0007](decisions/0007-authorship-and-accountability.md): authorship is a contributor set and legal
responsibility is a separable, possibly-absent, possibly-proxied attribute
([data-model §3.9](data-model.md#39-authorship-and-accountability)). The notification-economy item (10)
is unaffected — it concerns priority/noise, not authorship.

**Deferred follow-ons (not blocking):**
- **Closed role-enum membership** — the bearing/non-bearing *partition* is settled; the exact member list
  is to be finalised in `data-model.md` (`dictated`, `reviewed`, `co-signed` are candidates).
- **AI-agent identity registry** — registration, keying, version-pinning, and key custody for non-human
  actors; relation to the §9 trusted base and the keystore (a safety-critical / blast-radius concern).
- **Additive-vs-suppressing classification** — author-declared, output-type-derived, or both; and how it
  is validated/enforced where policy demands. The sharpest of the follow-ons; may warrant its own
  case-mining session.
- **Proxy/liability semantics** — what `on_behalf_of` legally binds is out of scope; Cairn records the
  chain, jurisdictions interpret it.
