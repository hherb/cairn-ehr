# Decision Log (ADRs)

This directory holds Cairn's **Architecture Decision Records**. Each ADR captures *why* a decision
was made — the context, the choice, and its consequences. Aspect documents in
[../](../index.md) describe *what* the architecture is; ADRs explain *why* it is that way.

## Rules

- **Append-only and immutable.** An ADR is never edited to reverse it. To change a decision, write
  a **new** ADR that supersedes the old one; mark the old one `Status: Superseded by ADR-NNNN` and
  the new one `Supersedes: ADR-NNNN`. This is the project's own *"never erase, always overlay"*
  ([identity §5.1](../identity.md#51-linkage-layer-never-merge-always-link)) applied to its
  documentation. (Typo/clarity fixes that don't change meaning are fine.)
- **Numbered and dated.** `NNNN-short-slug.md`, zero-padded, allocated in order.
- **Read before reopening.** Before reopening a settled question, read its ADR — the rationale is
  there on purpose.
- The spec carries **no in-file changelogs**; git is the line history and ADRs are the rationale.
