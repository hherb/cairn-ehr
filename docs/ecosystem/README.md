# Ecosystem evaluations

This directory holds Cairn's **ecosystem evaluations** — design analyses that weigh *external* infrastructure
(candidate plugins, adjacent tools, optional extensions) against the *decided* architecture (the numbered spec
§1–§11 and the [Decision log](../spec/decisions/README.md)).

An ecosystem evaluation is **not architecture and not a decision**. It is the *why of fit*: what an external project
is, where it lands in the [four-layer model](../spec/decisions/0021-layering-the-node-api-and-ui-pluralism.md)
(L0 wire core / L1 enforcement floor / L2 policy+API / L3 UI), which existing primitives it composes with, and what
would have to be true for it to attach **without compromising the safety floor or inter-node compatibility**. Every
subject here is an *optional* extension: a bare Cairn node is a complete EHR without it.

## Why a separate area

The spec stays a clean statement of *what Cairn is*; the [ADR log](../spec/decisions/README.md) stays a clean
statement of *why Cairn decided what it did*. An evaluation of someone else's software is a third thing — *what we
looked at, and what we concluded about fit* — and belongs in neither. When an evaluation surfaces a genuine
architectural commitment, that commitment is ratified separately as an ADR; the evaluation only flags it.

Disease/injury: **ICD-11 ratified as canonical interlingua → [ADR-0025](../spec/decisions/0025-icd-11-canonical-interlingua-and-local-terminology-overlay.md)** (verbatim codes, offline container, local-terminology overlay); ICPC-3 resolved to CC BY-ND and **declined** (no gain over the ICD-11 anchor + licensing-income capture risk); Mondo/ORDO (CC BY 4.0) clean substrate; SNOMED/ICD-10-AM/ICPC-2-PLUS excluded. |
