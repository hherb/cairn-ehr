# HANDOVER — Cairn

**Session date:** 2026-06-27 · **Spec/ADRs:** v0.36 · **Phase:** architecture complete; **first production clinical
surface under construction** — the demographics tier on `cairn-node` (slice 1 = §4.4 identifiers; **slice 2 = §4.2 DOB +
sex-at-birth, this session**). Viability proven by spikes (walking skeleton, advisory-actor contract, a first federating
node, Postgres-on-Android).

**This session (2026-06-27):** built demographics **slice 2 = the §4.2 DOB + sex-at-birth provenance-locked fields**
(brainstorm→spec→plan→subagent-SDD, 5 TDD tasks; spec+plan under `docs/superpowers/`). Introduces the **new mechanic
slice 1 deliberately avoided**: *provenance-precedence projection*. A generic **`demographic.field.asserted`** event (a
`field` discriminator) flows through the **reused** `submit_event` door (never re-declared); **`db/011_demographics_fields.sql`**
adds **`cairn_provenance_rank`** — the §4.1 ladder as a total order, with a **new `fact-proven` top tier (70)** above
`document-verified` (laboratory/scientifically-established truth overriding mere attestation; unrecognized→0 so it can never
displace a known value) — the culture-neutral floor **`cairn_check_demographic_field`** (generic checks + a dob-only
`facets.precision` requirement, principle 4; never parses a date/sex), and the **winner-by-`(rank, HLC, origin)`
`patient_demographic` projection** (PK `(patient_id, field)`; "verified value **locks** vs. lower provenance" falls out;
recency breaks equal-provenance ties). **The load-bearing design call: the floor stays OPEN, the projection is GATED** — an
unknown `field` (a newer node's `gender-identity`) **passes the floor, is stored + legible via its twin, but is not projected**
(required for set-union federation, ADR-0012; never reject a peer's field). Full assertion history stays in `event_log` as the
matching evidence (winner-only projection, no retained-set table). Pure **`cairn-event::demographics`** builders
(`dob_assertion_body`/`sex_at_birth_assertion_body` + twins). Canonical **spec §4.1 ladder** prose extended to name
`fact-proven`. TDD on **PG18+cairn_pgx**: 7 integration tests (happy path · provenance-beats-recency + verified-locks ·
recency-among-equals · 6 floor rejections · unknown-field carried-not-projected · fact-proven displacement · slice-1/legacy
regression), all green; full workspace suite green, clippy clean. Final opus whole-branch review: **ready to merge, no
Critical/Important**. Filed **[issue #69](https://github.com/cairn-ehr/cairn-ehr/issues/69)** (codebase-wide: projection
winner tiebreak compares `node_origin` as collation-sensitive text — negligible blast radius, left consistent with
`patient_chart`/`patient_identifier`). **Noted clinical caveat** carried into the design for the later sex-expansion slice:
`fact-proven` karyotype auto-displacing a `document-verified` assigned-sex is a *field-semantics* question (sex-**at-birth** =
assigned vs. karyotype = a different fact), deliberately deferred; `event_log` retains both regardless. **Explicit deferrals:**
names (multi-valued + display-winner), administrative-sex, gender-identity (recency-wins), the §5.2 matcher/veto, globalising
the authored twin, a CLI verb.

**Earlier today (2026-06-27):** built demographics **slice 1 = the §4.4 patient-identifier assertion** end-to-end
(brainstorm→spec→plan→subagent-SDD, 4 TDD tasks; spec+plan under `docs/superpowers/`): an additive
**`EventBody.plaintext_twin`** field carrying the §4.5 authored twin in the signed body (additive-only — a `None` twin
omits from the wire, content-addresses unchanged; two CBOR tests pin it); pure **`cairn-event::demographics`** builders
(`identifier_assertion_body` + `render_identifier_twin`); **`db/010_demographics.sql`** — the culture-neutral §4.4 floor
helper `cairn_check_identifier_assertion` (distinct structural RAISEs: value/system/provenance non-empty,
**normalized non-empty string when present**, **normalized⇒profile**; never a checksum/format/profile-hold), a per-type
**`cairn_event_twin` hook** (called by the **unchanged** db/005 `submit_event` — *not* a re-declaration of the door)
that runs the §4.4 floor and carries the **authored** twin for demographic events, with legacy types falling back to the
derived skeleton twin (`cairn_twin_skeleton`), and the **set-union `patient_identifier` projection** (PK `(patient_id,
system, coalesce(normalized, value))`, `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`, trigger scoped to the demographic type). Integration
tests on **PG18+cairn_pgx**: happy-path (proves authored-twin passthrough), set-union dedup, honest degradation
(profile-less accepted), all **floor rejections** (each isolated, triple-gated: error + empty `event_log` + empty
projection), legacy regression. All green (cairn-event 19, cairn-node 130+), clippy clean. **Post-review fixes (this
session):** (1) the floor now also rejects a whitespace-only `normalized` (it would otherwise project a whitespace
`match_key`, silently conflating distinct identifiers); (2) the demographic twin/floor was lifted out of a 140-line
byte-faithful `submit_event` copy into the `cairn_event_twin` hook above, so the validated write door stays
single-source in db/005 and cannot drift. **Explicit deferrals:** matching/veto (§5.2, the advisory matcher), a CLI
authoring verb, and globalising the authored twin to all event types. Filed **[issue #67](https://github.com/cairn-ehr/cairn-ehr/issues/67)**
(pre-existing: `db/008` surrogate-projection migration is absent from the `cairn-node` SCHEMA array).

**Earlier today (2026-06-27):** closed demographics **gap B** — the provider-number person×org relational model (the last
deferred piece of ADR-0033). New **[ADR-0035](spec/decisions/0035-entities-relationships-and-provider-numbers.md)** +
**demographics §4.6**; spec 0.35→0.36. Model: an abstract identity-bearing **entity** (open `kind`: person/org/location/…)
carrying §4.4-verbatim identifier sets; **reified relationships** between entities carrying their own identifier sets
(where the AU Medicare provider number lives, tying a person to an org at a location); **subject-kind partitioning**
(`{patient, entity, relationship}`) that makes ADR-0033's non-conflation **structural** — a billing number can never be a
patient match key or a signing credential; a **one-way non-authorizing `actor_ref`** keeping signing distinct from billing;
and **position-not-value** (the same AHPRA string may validly appear both as a §7.5 actor licensure credential and a §4.6
billing identifier — the WorkCover case). Entity/relationship *data* is fit-for-purpose; the partition tag + `actor_ref` +
floor invariants are safety-critical. Cross-refs added in identity §5.2 and security §7.5/§7.7. No new founding principle.
Design/spec work only — no code. **Demographics gaps A (§4.2), B (§4.4/§4.6), and C (§4.5) are all now closed.**

**Earlier today (2026-06-27):** closed demographics **gap C** — tied the [principle 11](index.md) legibility twin to
**all** demographic assertions. New **[ADR-0034](spec/decisions/0034-demographic-legibility-twin.md)** + **demographics
§4.5**. One uniform rule: every demographic assertion is a §3.13 event, so it already carries the mandatory signed
plaintext twin; §4.5 binds demographics to it, requires the twin **materialised at authoring + profile-independent**,
reconciles the ad-hoc §4.3 `display` / §4.4 `value` facets as the **value-core** the one twin wraps, and guarantees any
**future** field shape inherits it by construction. Floor enforces only "non-empty twin present"; `twin == render(value)`
is advisory. Explicit **legibility ≠ matching** boundary: the twin is for reading, matching still degrades to human review
per ADR-0032/0033. §3.13 cross-ref added; spec 0.34→0.35.

**Earlier today (2026-06-27):** closed the two demographics *representation* gaps that preceded gap C. **[ADR-0033](spec/decisions/0033-patient-identifier-representation.md)** + **§4.4** — patient-**identifier**
representation: splits the content-addressed **`system` namespace** (stable hard-veto key, e.g. `nhs-number`) from the
separately-versioned **`profile`** (format/checksum/normalizer/comparator bundle); veto keys on a **`normalized` form
materialised at authoring** so it **survives honest degradation** (a profile-less node holds for human review, never
declares a mismatch from formatting noise — `9434765919` == `943 476 5919`); validation advisory; patient-vs-professional
boundary stated (provider-number person×org model **deferred**). **[ADR-0032](spec/decisions/0032-culture-neutral-address-representation.md)** + **§4.3** — culture-neutral address: the
three-facet value (mandatory `display` + optional precision-aware `geo` + optional culture-tagged `structured` parts via a
content-addressed locale **profile** reusing the ADR-0014 bundle); no canonical part names, country is a part, honest
degradation when a profile is absent. Both: floor keeps only structural invariants, never holds a profile; spec 0.32→0.34.
(Also recovered an old single-jurisdiction GP EHR schema — DDL only, no patient data — as a private, out-of-repo design
reference; full notes private, product-neutrality preserved.)

**Prior session (2026-06-26):** closed [issue #53](https://github.com/cairn-ehr/cairn-ehr/issues/53) — **cold-medium
self-identification on restore**. A federated backup medium holds the node's OWN genesis *and* every peer's; by
set-union convergence a node's `node_event` set is byte-identical to its peers', so the events alone cannot say which
enroll is "self" — `restore --superseded-node` could name a *peer* and write a wrong, immutable `supersede` edge + adopt
the peer's name. Fix: a **container-level self-marker** written at backup time (when `local_node` is authoritative), NOT
derivable from events. New **`crates/cairn-node/src/medium.rs`** (the medium container format, extracted out of
`backup.rs`): `CAIRNB2` carries a `SelfMarker` — **Signed** (a `node.self_attested` event held only in the container,
never inserted/synced) or **Unsigned** (self node-id, operator-error-safe). `restore::resolve_dead_node` reads the
marker (Signed → authoritative; explicit `--superseded-node` validated against it, a peer/off-medium id rejected
fail-closed `NotSelf`; Unsigned/legacy flagged for confirmation). The signed attestation is **unforgeable** (no private
key on the medium) AND **event-set-bound** — a sorted `event_set_commitment` ties it to this exact set, rejecting a
marker spliced from a backup with a *different* set. **Known residual (caught in code review of this PR):** the
commitment binds to set *content*, and two fully-converged peers hold *byte-identical* sets, so it **cannot** reject a
peer's genuine marker spliced between converged media. That splice is impossible on a **sole-enroll** medium (foreign id
absent → fail closed), so the risk is exactly the **multi-enroll/federated** case → restore reports
`Provenance::SignedFederated` and asks the operator to confirm the echoed name/address (defence: confirm-on-restore +
physical custody, not the commitment). So: **forgery-proof always; misdirect-proof for sole-enroll media and
different-set splices; a converged-peer splice is a confirm-on-restore residual, never a silent misdirect.** Unsigned
never blocks a backup (just flagged); legacy `CAIRNB1` media degrade honestly. `backup` signs when the key is
non-interactively available else unsigned+warning; `restore` warns per provenance + echoes the adopted identity
(paper-parity). Brainstorm→TDD, `medium.rs` no-DB; full `cairn-node` suite green (76 lib + all integration), clippy
clean. An adversarial subagent review caught the different-set splice (→ commitment bind); the PR code review then caught
the converged-identical-set residual (→ honest `SignedFederated` provenance + tests pinning the limitation).

**Prior session (2026-06-26):** closed [issue #54](https://github.com/cairn-ehr/cairn-ehr/issues/54) — **uniform
key-material zeroization** across `seal.rs` + `localstate.rs`: every transient secret (Argon2id KEKs, DEK, recovered
signing seed, local-state LSK) held in `zeroize::Zeroizing`; key-yielding fns return `Zeroizing<[u8;32]>`. Defence-in-depth
(no secret leaked to disk/logs today). **All ADR-0026 node-durability follow-ons now closed; only optional escrow rungs
(Shamir/QR/TPM) remain.**

**Prior session (2026-06-25):** ADR-0026 **slice D** — the sealed **local-state export** (point 3), which **closes the
last open ADR-0026 slice (A–D all done)**. No spec/ADR change (implementation of point 3). The federation-node tier has
**no clinical surface yet**, so the export's *content* is intentionally **empty today**; the deliverable is the
can't-retrofit **shape**: a long-lived **local-state DEK (LSK)** dual-wrapped **once at provisioning** (op-passphrase +
recovery code) so `backup` re-encrypts under it with the op-pass alone (ADR-0026 point-5 compliant — no recovery code at
backup time) and `restore` decrypts via the old recovery code. The **signing key is never in the bundle** (point 4). New
`crates/cairn-node/src/localstate.rs` (versioned `LocalState` with typed-empty slots + additive CBOR; reuses `seal.rs`
primitives — no duplicated crypto; `CAIRNL1` export container co-located with the backup medium + `CAIRNX1` `.lsk`
sidecar; DB read/apply **seams** the clinical tier extends, empty/noop today). CLI: `.lsk` established at
`init`/`seal-key`, new `establish-local-state-key` verb, `backup` writes the export sibling, `restore` consumes it,
`status` `local_state` line. **No DB schema change.** Built via brainstorm→plan→subagent-SDD (6 TDD tasks, per-task +
opus whole-branch review; spec+plan under `docs/superpowers/`). **Honest degradation on both ends** (the events are the
load-bearing copy, the export is optional): `restore` warns+skips an absent/corrupt/unsealable export; `backup` warns+skips
when the export can't be sealed (no passphrase in an unattended run, wrong passphrase, I/O error) rather than aborting an
already-complete event backup — review fix, drove the `localstate::build_export_container` helper. The day-one escrow is
**re-established under fresh secrets** on every key-minting/re-sealing path (`init`/`seal-key`/`restore`, `overwrite=true`)
so the `.lsk` never desyncs from a just-resealed signing key; the explicit `establish-local-state-key` verb still refuses
to clobber an existing escrow — review fix. Full `cairn-node` suite green (19/19 binaries). Follow-up [issue #54](https://github.com/cairn-ehr/cairn-ehr/issues/54)
(uniform LSK/DEK zeroization across `seal.rs`+`localstate.rs`) — **closed this session (2026-06-26), see above.**

**Prior sessions (2026-06-25):** ADR-0026 **slice C** — restore (apply) + new-identity `supersede`
([PR #52](https://github.com/cairn-ehr/cairn-ehr/pull/52), [issue #50](https://github.com/cairn-ehr/cairn-ehr/issues/50)):
`cairn-node restore` rehydrates `node_event` into a fresh DB under a freshly-minted key, records `supersede`(dead→new);
self-trusting `restore_node_event` door (empty-genesis fenced); `db/009` + `node_lineage`. **Slice B** — backup-as-cold-peer
export+verify+health ([PR #51](https://github.com/cairn-ehr/cairn-ehr/pull/51)). And Spike 0003 (Postgres on Android)
**G0–G3 PASS** ([PR #47](https://github.com/cairn-ehr/cairn-ehr/pull/47), [PR #48](https://github.com/cairn-ehr/cairn-ehr/pull/48)).

**Status of this file:** Disposable working scaffolding, **not** a source of truth. Regenerate at the end
of each session. If it ever disagrees with the canonical docs, **the canonical docs win.** The *why* lives
in the immutable ADR log; the *what* lives in the spec; this file only carries what lives *between* them —
current build state, open threads, and time-sensitive items.

---

## Read these first (the durable state)

- **`docs/spec/index.md`** — canonical architecture spec (mission prose + document map + spec version).
  One file per aspect; cross-refs like *§5.7* stay valid inside the aspect file.
- **`docs/spec/decisions/`** — the **ADR log** (the *why*). Numbered, dated, **immutable** (a reversal is a
  new superseding ADR). **Read the relevant ADR before reopening a settled question.** Index below.
- **`docs/ROADMAP.md`** — the foundation build order (wire core → in-DB floor → sync → identity →
  security → federation → blobs → native API), *below* the policy/GUI line. Disposable scaffolding like
  this file; the spec/ADRs win on any disagreement.
- **`docs/spikes/`** — build-prep records (*what we tried, on what, what we learned*). Not spec, not ADR.
- **`docs/principles/`** — mission/governance; **`GOVERNANCE.md`** + `STEWARDSHIP-OF-THE-NAME.md`.
- Root **`README.md`** — mission + founding principles (same prose as `index.md`).
- Code workspace: `/crates` (`cairn-event`, `cairn-sync`, `cairn-node`), `/extensions` (`cairn_pgx`), `/db`.
  `poc/` is frozen historical spikes.

## Stale-doc cleanup — done this session

- **Status lines realigned** (spec/index.md, README.md ×2, GOVERNANCE.md ×2): were "Architecture / specification
  phase — no implementation yet" (and GOVERNANCE flatly claimed *"implementation has not started"*); now framed as
  *spec complete; proving viability through proof-of-concept spikes; no clinical implementation yet.*
- **`docs/spikes/README.md` Spike 0002 row fixed** — was *"Proposed — not yet run,"* now *"Ran ✓ — C1–C5 PASS
  (PR #27) → ADR-0029/0030."*
- **CLAUDE.md updated** — opening reframed from "no code, build system, or tests yet" to the
  proof-of-concept-spikes framing, and a new **"Coding house rules"** section enshrined (AGPL-3.0 + compatible
  deps · TDD · inline docs for a junior dev · pure reusable functions over clever complexity · fix review findings
  or file a GitHub issue).

## Where the build actually is (the live, in-progress state)

### First federating node — built 2026-06-21, [PR #28](https://github.com/cairn-ehr/cairn-ehr/pull/28)
First *implementation* of [ADR-0017](spec/decisions/0017-federation-admission-sovereignty-peering-and-trust-anchors.md)
(federation admission), scoped to **direct-pairwise trust, no clinical surface** — only the federation
machinery flows, exercising the one safety-critical seam (*verified credential → admitted peer*) E2E. **No
spec/ADR change.** Built: `cairn-node` (Ed25519 keystore, `init`/`identity`/pairing/`peers`/`unpeer`, built-in
mTLS pinned to the trust set, set-union `node_event` sync, honest `status`); `db/007` append-only `node_event`
+ `submit_node_event` door + `apply_remote_node_event` deny-all admission gate (reuses `cairn_verify` pgrx — no
new crypto). Genesis-stable `node_id` = content-address of the genesis enrollment event. Two-node E2E green on
local PG16 + `cairn_pgx`.

**Honest gaps / follow-ons declared in the node (candidate "harden the node" work):**
- ~~`status` **crashes if run before `init`**~~ **closed 2026-06-23** — `load_local_opt` (`query_opt`) +
  an `initialized` flag; `status` degrades honestly with a "run `cairn-node init`" hint
  (`tests/status.rs::status_before_init_degrades_gracefully`).
- **In-DB floor caveat** — ~~runtime should connect as a login role granted `cairn_node` (NOLOGIN)~~
  **closed 2026-06-23**: `db::provision_runtime_role` (charset-guarded against DDL injection) + a
  `provision-runtime-role` CLI subcommand create that role, and `tests/floor_enforced.rs` now **proves the
  ENFORCED path** — over a `cairn_node`-granted login role a raw `INSERT` into `node_event` is denied
  (SQLSTATE 42501), `status` reports `db_floor ENFORCED`, yet `submit_node_event` still works.
- ~~**Key-at-rest plaintext-0600**; **DR/recovery escrow a named stub** (`dr_escrow: STUBBED`)~~ **closed
  2026-06-24** (ADR-0026 **slice A**, [PR #44](https://github.com/cairn-ehr/cairn-ehr/pull/44)): the signing key is now **sealed at rest** — a random DEK seals the
  seed (XChaCha20-Poly1305), DEK **dual-wrapped** under Argon2id KEKs from an operational passphrase
  **and** a one-time **recovery code** (paper escrow, shown once at `init`). New pure `seal.rs`
  (seal/unseal/CBOR + base32 recovery code); `keystore` gained `generate_sealed`/`generate_plaintext`/
  `seal_existing` + auto-detect `load` + `key_at_rest_state`; CLI seals by default (`--insecure-plaintext`
  escape hatch) and added `seal-key` migration; daemon unseals via `CAIRN_KEY_PASSPHRASE`. `status` now
  reports `key_at_rest SEALED` + `dr_escrow recovery code set` + `recovery_escrow`. **Honest ceiling
  (documented, not engineered away): lose both the passphrase AND the recovery code → node loss.**
- ~~Genesis **HLC 0/0 placeholder**; **full-pull, no incremental watermark**~~ **closed 2026-06-23**
  ([issue #38](https://github.com/cairn-ehr/cairn-ehr/issues/38), **merged [PR #42](https://github.com/cairn-ehr/cairn-ehr/pull/42)**):
  incremental pull keyed on a monotonic local-insertion `node_event.seq` (a node always inserts newly-learned
  events with a fresh high `seq`, so the watermark is **structurally** skip-proof — decoupling it from the HLC,
  which dissolved the stated coupling), per-peer `sync_cursor` written only through an advance-only
  `checkpoint_sync_cursor` `SECURITY DEFINER` door (the runtime role keeps **zero raw DML**), with an explicit
  periodic + trust-change-triggered **full-sweep** as the correctness floor for the residual commit-order /
  rejected-then-trusted / address-remap hazards. The `0/0` HLC is now a real local clock (`hlc_state` +
  `node_hlc_tick()` + merge-forward on apply, mirroring `cairn-sync`). Acceptance test
  `sync_watermark::out_of_order_skip_is_reconciled_by_full_sweep` proves a jammed-cursor skip is reconciled by
  the sweep; the seq prefix is transport-only (signed core byte-identical, principle 12). Full node suite green
  on PG16 + `cairn_pgx`, clippy clean.
- ~~**backup-as-cold-peer** + backup-health (slice B)~~ **export half closed this session**: `backup`/`verify-backup`
  CLI + `last_backup` status line; signed-event medium, self-verifying via the existing signature invariant (tamper
  → non-zero exit); fail-safe node-local health sidecar; **verify-before-write** (the image self-verifies *before* the
  atomic rename, so a bad set never overwrites the previous good medium) plus a read-after-write tripwire gate the
  health update so it never over-claims. New `backup.rs` (pure medium format + verify + health) + shared `fsio`
  atomic-write.
- ~~**Restore (apply) + new-identity `supersede`** (slice C, [#50](https://github.com/cairn-ehr/cairn-ehr/issues/50))~~
  **closed**: `cairn-node restore` + self-trusting `restore_node_event` door (empty-genesis fenced), `supersede`(dead→new),
  fresh-key mint, `status` `supersedes` line. `db/009` + a `supersede` branch in `submit_node_event` (db/007). Residual
  footgun ~~[#53](https://github.com/cairn-ehr/cairn-ehr/issues/53) (a federated medium's `--superseded-node` could name a
  peer)~~ **closed this session** via the container-level self-marker (`medium.rs`, `CAIRNB2`; signed+medium-bound or
  unsigned) — see top.
- ~~**Sealed local-state export** (slice D, ADR-0026 point 3)~~ **closed this session**: `localstate.rs` (LSK dual-wrap,
  `CAIRNL1`/`CAIRNX1` containers, additive `LocalState` with empty slots, DB seams); `.lsk` at provisioning;
  `establish-local-state-key`; `backup` writes / `restore` consumes the export; `status` `local_state` line. **All ADR-0026
  slices (A–D) now done.** Remaining escrow *rungs* (Shamir M-of-N, QR, TPM/keyring) are optional upward options, not blockers.
- ~~atomic key-file write ([issue #45](https://github.com/cairn-ehr/cairn-ehr/issues/45)); passphrase
  `zeroize`-on-drop ([issue #46](https://github.com/cairn-ehr/cairn-ehr/issues/46))~~ **closed 2026-06-25**:
  `write_key_file` is now atomic (temp sibling → fsync → `rename` → **parent-dir fsync**, 0600 forced
  explicitly), so an interrupted `init`/`seal-key` can never leave a half-written key that boots `Corrupt`,
  the rename itself survives a power loss (not just the bytes), and a stale wide-perm `<key>.tmp` can no longer
  leak its mode onto the key; the operational passphrase and recovery code are held as `Zeroizing<String>`
  from `resolve_passphrase`/prompt through to the Argon2 call, wiped on drop (`zeroize` was already a transitive
  dep — no new crate). TDD: red-first tests for the new `tmp_sibling` helper, no-temp-litter, stale-temp clobber,
  0600 perms, stale-wide-perm-temp non-leak, and the `Zeroizing` return type. (PR #49 review: + dir fsync,
  explicit 0600, non-unix fsync.)
- Test rig: DB-gated tests need local PG + `cairn_pgx` (`cargo pgrx install` against PG16); they self-serialize
  cluster-wide via a Postgres advisory lock (`db::test_serial_guard`), so plain `cargo test --workspace` is reliable.

### Spike 0002 (advisory-actor write contract) — ran 2026-06-21, C1–C5 PASS, [PR #27](https://github.com/cairn-ehr/cairn-ehr/pull/27) → ADR-0029 + ADR-0030
An external advisory agent authored an additive, un-attested, recallable advisory through the validated in-DB
door, **and the floor rejected all five hostile-agent attacks** with legible reasons. PR #27 review (the user)
caught two real floor holes the spike's own review missed — forged authorship (unbound `signer_key_id`) and a
`PUBLIC`-executable `SECURITY DEFINER` door — both fixed before merge (recorded in ADR-0030).

**Honest gap (closed 2026-06-22):** the attestation **success** path (a *valid*, correctly-bound
token accepted) was never exercised E2E — now closed by `cairn-sync attest-stdin` (the token minter),
`crates/cairn-node/tests/attestation.rs` (accept for responsibility-bearing + suppressing events; reject for
wrong-address, tampered, and non-human-attester), and `spike_0002.py` selftest (external-actor accept +
wrong-address/tamper). No `submit_event` logic changed — the accept branch already existed; this is the
coverage that was missing. **Smaller deferred items remain open** (commented in code):
`events_by_actor_epoch` resolves against `actor_current` not historical `actor_event` rows;
`actor_current` wall-clock ordering needs a monotonic tiebreaker before production; no FK on
`recall_overlay.target_event_id`; plaintext twin is skeletal.

### Dual-identifier discipline — ADR-0031, merged 2026-06-22 ([PR #34](https://github.com/cairn-ehr/cairn-ehr/pull/34); `local_ref` honesty fix merged 2026-06-24 [PR #43](https://github.com/cairn-ehr/cairn-ehr/pull/43))
New **[ADR-0031](spec/decisions/0031-canonical-identifiers-and-node-local-surrogate-keys.md)** (canonical
identifiers + node-local surrogate keys): canonical plane (UUIDv7 + multihash) is unchanged and is the *only*
identifier on the wire/in signed bodies; the **projection plane** may intern canonical IDs to dense node-local
`bigint` surrogates as physical join keys. Leakage of a surrogate into a signed body = silent cross-node
corruption, so it is made *hard* (distinct domain type, mapping confined to floor functions, API egress always
the global ID). Landed with `db/008_surrogate_projection.sql` + the Bet B5 leakage guard. Final magnitude is
**measured on Bet B** (Pi), exactly as ADR-0001's compute bet — a "no measurable win" result narrows scope, not
fails the discipline.

**Honest gap (fixed 2026-06-24, [issue #35](https://github.com/cairn-ehr/cairn-ehr/issues/35)):** the prose
called the `local_ref` domain a "real two-way type barrier," but a PG domain over `bigint` is *not* — a
surrogate flows into any plain `bigint` with no cast/error (empirically confirmed). Corrected the wording in
`db/008`, spike 0001 §6.2, PI-RUNBOOK §6.1, and the walking-skeleton README to name the *actual* load-bearing
guarantee (signed plane typed `uuid` + `bigint ≠ uuid` + the G2 assertion) and to frame the domain honestly as
an intent-signal + one-directional guard. Rewrote **G4** in `db/tests/008_surrogate_test.sql`: it now asserts
the functions exist first (no more vacuous pass via `undefined_function`, now dropped), proves the genuine
guard (G4a `uuid`↛`local_ref`; G4b `bigint`↛`uuid` signed plane), and **characterizes the honest limit**
(G4c: `bigint` flows into `local_ref` silently). The spec body (§3.18) and immutable ADR-0031 were already
accurate (one-directional framing), so neither was touched. All G1–G6 green on PG16. **Merged 2026-06-24 ([PR #43](https://github.com/cairn-ehr/cairn-ehr/pull/43)).**

### Spike 0003 (Postgres on Android) — ran 2026-06-25, G0–G3 PASS, merged ([PR #47](https://github.com/cairn-ehr/cairn-ehr/pull/47) + [PR #48](https://github.com/cairn-ehr/cairn-ehr/pull/48))
Validated the **fractal-topology** invariant at the phone tier (RedMagic 11 Pro). Native PG 18.2 execs, `initdb`s,
serves SQL over TCP, and a cross-built pgrx extension loads + runs (incl. SPI) — no Termux userland, no root, no VM.
The one real blocker was `libandroid-shmem` (compile-baked Termux prefix + dead `/dev/ashmem`), fixed by a
self-contained, pinned-upstream patch. Runnable kit at [`poc/pg-android-kit/`](../poc/pg-android-kit/) + a
Medium-style write-up. **Remaining non-load-bearing gaps:** from-source PG build and APK/`jniLibs` packaging
(not blocking — the bet is proven). No spec/ADR change.

## Open threads — pick one (today's-work menu)

**Desk-doable now (no external dependency):**
- **Demographics build — next slices** (the live build front; reuse the spine in `db/010`/`db/011` +
  `cairn-event::demographics`). Slice 1 (§4.4 identifiers, set-union) and **slice 2 (§4.2 DOB + sex-at-birth,
  provenance-precedence) are done.** Remaining: **slice 3 candidates** — the §4.2 **names** field (multi-valued retained
  set **+** a display-winner pointer — a *different* projection shape) · **administrative-sex** + **gender-identity**
  (new `field` values reusing the slice-2 spine; gender-identity is the inverse *recency-wins* toggle) · the §4.3
  **address** three-facet value (display/geo/structured + locale profile). Then the §5.2 **matching pipeline + the §4.4
  hard veto** (advisory matcher — Python/fit-for-purpose) and **globalising the authored twin** to every event type
  (retire the `cairn_event_twin` skeleton fallback + its TODO). The slice-2 design carries a **deferred decision** for the
  sex-expansion slice: whether a `fact-proven` karyotype is the *same field* as assigned sex-at-birth (it currently
  auto-displaces in the projection) or a distinct field. DB-gated tests need
  `CAIRN_TEST_PG="host=127.0.0.1 port=5532 user=hherb dbname=cairn_test"` (PG18+cairn_pgx).
- **Clinical case-mining** — historically the highest-signal generative mode; the event-overlay + key-custody +
  actor primitives have absorbed every case so far without new architecture. Bring a real ED/hospital failure mode.
- **Dedupe transitive RustCrypto dep versions** in `Cargo.lock` ([issue #11](https://github.com/cairn-ehr/cairn-ehr/issues/11)) — supply-chain
  hygiene. **Re-verified 2026-06-25: still blocked on upstream** — the `postgres` stack pulls `digest 0.11`/`sha2 0.11`/`chacha20 0.10`
  while `chacha20poly1305 0.10.1` still depends on `chacha20 0.9` and `ed25519-dalek` on `digest 0.10`. Not fixable from our `Cargo.toml`; revisit when the ecosystem converges.
- **Harden the first federating node** — status-before-init crash, runtime-login-role/floor-ENFORCED proof,
  incremental sync watermark + genesis HLC ([#38](https://github.com/cairn-ehr/cairn-ehr/issues/38), PR #42),
  and **all four ADR-0026 durability slices** — A (at-rest seal + recovery escrow, PR #44), B (cold-peer export+health,
  PR #51), C (restore + `supersede`, PR #52), **D (sealed local-state export, this session)** — are all **closed**
  (see node gaps above). **ADR-0026 is fully implemented at the node tier.** No remaining required node-hardening thread;
  ~~[#54](https://github.com/cairn-ehr/cairn-ehr/issues/54) (uniform key zeroization)~~ and ~~[#53](https://github.com/cairn-ehr/cairn-ehr/issues/53)
  (federated-restore self-identification)~~ both **closed 2026-06-26**; only optional escrow rungs (Shamir/QR/TPM) remain.
  The `localstate` DB read/apply **seams** are where the future clinical tier plugs DEKs/drafts/config.
- **Landing-page polish** — non-developer page for the generated site (frontend-design; `web/` already advanced
  across PRs #15–#17; draft plans under `docs/superpowers/`).

**Blocked on hardware / external access:**
- **Bet B — Pi compute-cost run** ([Spike 0001 §9](spikes/0001-walking-skeleton-wan-sync-and-pi-cost.md#9-bet-b--results-raspberry-pi-5--8-gb-2026-06-25--pass-with-two-honest-caveats)):
  **RAN 2026-06-25 on a Pi 5 / 8 GB → PASS** (all §6 gates green, large headroom; B4 **confirms** ADR-0015's
  BLAKE3 blob-digest default — BLAKE3 ~4× SHA-256 on Cortex-A76). Artifacts in
  [`poc/walking-skeleton/results/`](../poc/walking-skeleton/results/). **Two caveats** (precision, not verdict):
  storage ran on a **USB-2-limited dock** (power-offload workaround after a Pi 5 brown-out saga — see the §9.2
  *deployment-BOM finding*: PSU + storage-attachment path are part of the validated BOM), and on **PG 16**
  because **`cairn_pgx` is pgrx-0.12.9 / `pg16`-pinned and won't build on PG 18** (§9.3). Bonus: `cairn_pgx`
  builds+loads on Pi arm64 (in-DB Rust surface confirmed on ARM). **Open follow-ups:** ~~(a) port `cairn_pgx` to a
  PG-18-capable pgrx~~ **done 2026-06-25 ([PR #56](https://github.com/cairn-ehr/cairn-ehr/pull/56): pgrx 0.12.9 → 0.18.1,
  default feature `pg16`→`pg18`)**; (b) clean re-run on **PG 18 + USB-3 SSD + official 27 W PSU** for authoritative
  precision numbers; (c) fold the B4 number into the ADR-0015 follow-up to drop "provisional" from the blob-digest line.
- **easyGP session** — port the [ADR-0020](spec/decisions/0020-active-write-thin-encounters-and-the-delete-vs-erase-distinction.md)
  deferred items with live easyGP schema access: the `rx!`/`tx!` type-through parser + state machine; the
  formulation/drug data source + renal/hepatic/pregnancy/paediatric **forced-manual** rule table; the
  prefetch/materialization warming daemon (validates ADR-0001 from production). Pre-read
  `scratch/ui-sketches/easygp-prefetch-notes.md`.
- **Byte-tier throughput lever** — connection reuse / persistent streaming instead of one TCP connection per
  slice (the production object-store tier). The §8.2 availability + windowing/resume work already shipped.

## Parked (don't re-litigate without new reason)

- **Stewarding legal entity & jurisdiction** (German Stiftung/Verein, US 501(c)(3), or an umbrella) — deferred
  until momentum/funding geography is clearer.
- **Formal trademark / wordmark registration** — principle recorded (stewardship doc); legal instrument deferred.

## Working context (most also in CLAUDE.md)

- The user is a senior **EM physician**, GNUmed founder (early FOSS Postgres EHR), codes mostly in Python, brings
  real ED/hospital failure modes from multiple health systems. **The mission (anti-capture / anti-vendor-lock-in)
  is the tie-breaker.** Criticism is strongly encouraged — surface flaws/risks immediately.
- **Twelve founding principles** run through everything ([index.md](spec/index.md)); the first four are the lens
  for every design choice: (1) append-only + causal ordering; (2) identity is a claim — never merge/erase, always
  link/overlay; (3) paper-parity (no confirmation dialogs); (4) acknowledged uncertainty. See CLAUDE.md for the
  full set (5–12) and the §9 defect-blast-radius language-selection rule.
- **Governance done** ([GOVERNANCE.md](principles/GOVERNANCE.md) + root `CONTRIBUTING.md`): AGPL-3.0 inbound=outbound,
  DCO, **no CLA**; mission as tie-breaker. Names/domains/packages secured (`cairn-ehr` org; `cairn-ehr.org`+`.com`;
  PyPI/crates.io/npm `@cairn-ehr` placeholders).
