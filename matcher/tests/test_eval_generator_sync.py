"""Drift canary: pin the generator's recoverability predicate to the real blocking SQL.

`generator.shares_blocking_key` is a hand-maintained mirror of the base blocking passes in
`pipeline/db.py`'s `_GROUPS_SQL` — the two are coupled only by a comment. The coupling is
*asymmetric*: if a future edit WIDENS the SQL (adds a pass) the predicate merely over-repairs
(still safe); but if an edit NARROWS or renames a base pass the predicate keeps claiming those
pairs are recoverable, so `_repair` skips them and the DB silently drops true matches — a break
that only the DB-gated volume test would catch, and only when a database is configured.

This test gives the FAST (no-DB) suite that missing signal: it asserts every base pass the
predicate leans on is still present in the SQL text. It needs psycopg only to import the SQL
constant (no connection), so it degrades cleanly to a skip where the extra is absent.
