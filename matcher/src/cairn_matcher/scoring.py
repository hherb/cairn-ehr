"""The Fellegi–Sunter combiner: agreement vector + weights -> explainable match score.

Classic Fellegi–Sunter assigns each field, at each agreement level, a log-weight
log2(m/u) — positive when agreement is more likely under a match than a non-match,
negative for disagreement. The total match score is the sum of per-field log-weights: a
log-likelihood ratio. Two Cairn-specific properties:

  * INSUFFICIENT_DATA contributes EXACTLY ZERO — a missing field is never a penalty
    (§3.7, the no-data-is-never-disagreement principle).
  * each weight is scaled by provenance_factor(rank) — a *verified* clash or agreement
    weighs more than an *imported/unknown* one (§4.2, provenance-aware).

This module owns NO threshold and makes NO decision. It returns a score with a per-field
breakdown; banding it against the conservative auto-link threshold is the in-DB floor's
job. The m/u weights here are shipped DEFAULTS; learning them from local adjudication
data is a later slice (B3).
