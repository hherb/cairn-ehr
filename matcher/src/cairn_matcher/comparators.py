"""The culture-neutral comparator set + the in-house Jaro–Winkler primitive.

Every comparator is pure and field-typed (agreement.Comparator). Each returns
INSUFFICIENT_DATA when a side is absent — a missing field is ZERO evidence, never a
penalty (§3.7, the no-data-is-never-disagreement principle made mechanical).

Jaro–Winkler is implemented here rather than pulled from a dependency: it is short,
fully testable, reviewer-legible, and keeps the project dependency-free (supply-chain
hygiene, house rule #1).
