"""Batch driver (piece B2b): generate candidate pairs, score each via propose().

This is the front end B2 lacked — it decides WHICH pairs to score (db.generate_candidate_pairs,
the blocking passes) and feeds each through the existing pairwise propose(). Pure
orchestration over the db + runner seam; no scoring/banding logic lives here.

Two phases. Phase 1 generates the candidates, then closes the read snapshot BEFORE the
write loop so a long sweep does not pin the xmin horizon (the hazard runner.propose
already guards on its own sub-threshold path). Phase 2 loops propose() per pair: each is
its own transaction and idempotent (human status preserved on re-run), so the sweep is
resumable, and a failing pair is recorded and skipped (house rule #5) rather than aborting
the batch.

Requires the optional `pipeline` extra (psycopg) at CALL time, because it drives db/runner.
