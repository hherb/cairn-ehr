"""Run the real scoring+banding pipeline over a labelled dataset -> ScorerMetrics.

Pure: it reuses the production scoring path (orchestrator -> scoring -> banding), so the
metrics describe the real matcher, not a stand-in. weights/thresholds/config are
PARAMETERS — sweeping them is exactly how weight-learning will use this harness.

Caveat (documented in the spec): banding is called with NO vetoes here. The pure eval
measures scorer+threshold quality in isolation; the in-DB veto can cap a high score at
REVIEW, so these metrics are slightly optimistic vs the end-to-end banded outcome. A
veto-aware mode is a later, additive extension.

Complexity is O(N^2) in records (every pair scored). Fine for the small gold set; that
O(N^2) is precisely what the blocking layer measures how to avoid at scale.
