"""The comparator contract and the graded-agreement vocabulary (ADR-0014 §Decision 2).

A comparator is a PURE, field-typed function returning a graded AgreementLevel, never a
boolean — because Fellegi–Sunter weighs each level of agreement differently. The levels
are ordinal (higher = stronger agreement) so that name-set matching can pick the best
agreement across a cross-product with a plain max().

PHONETIC and NICKNAME exist in the vocabulary as the reserved plug points for locale
packs (a later slice). NO comparator in this core emits them — shipping a phonetic
encoder (Soundex is anglo) or a nickname lexicon (cultural) in the core would be the
"cultural capture" ADR-0014 forbids.
