//! ADR-0026 slice C — restore orchestration (apply a backup medium under a new identity),
//! plus the self-identification of a cold medium (issue #53).
//!
//! WHY: the live apply_remote_node_event gate is the PEER-admission path and rejects a node
//! rehydrating its OWN history (no trust set in a fresh DB). Restore therefore uses the
//! self-trusting restore_node_event door (db/009), then mints a fresh key and records a
//! node-level supersede (the old signing key is never backed up). This module holds the PURE
//! helpers (which enroll on the medium is "self", old-genesis metadata) and the thin DB
//! orchestration; main.rs owns key-minting + recovery-code printing (as `init` does).
//!
//! Identifying self is NOT derivable from the events: by set-union sync a node's `node_event`
//! set CONVERGES with its peers', so the events alone cannot say which enroll is local. Self
//! is read from the medium's container-level self-marker, written at backup time (see
//! [`crate::medium`]). A SIGNED marker on a SOLE-enroll medium is authoritative and tamper-evident.
//! A SIGNED marker on a MULTI-enroll (federated/converged) medium still resolves self correctly
//! absent an adversary, but cannot — by construction — rule out a peer-medium splice (converged
//! peers hold byte-identical event sets; see [`crate::medium`]), so it is surfaced as
//! [`Provenance::SignedFederated`] for operator confirmation. An UNSIGNED marker pins self
//! (operator-error-safe) but is flagged; a marker-less legacy medium falls back to an explicit
//! `--superseded-node` (or a sole-enroll medium).
